TODO: Remove objects around player ship at startup.
-----
make number of objects equal to cpu load
first start:
    'benchmarking computer...'
    'how much percent should your cpu be used? <>'
-----
enumerate([])
-----
Enemies for single levels would be in the options.py
After each level, sprites not needed anymore should be removed from the Container.
-----
Make it possible, to give enemies _custom_ AI via the options or level files.
-----
multiplayer:
    Players begin on opposite ends of the screen and try to reach the other end.
    They can't shoot each other.
    Could also be made with spawnable ships for money for strategy stuff and the like.
-----

cyan: Like blue, but move randomly on x. More health.
green: Are slow, shooting and give ammo when crashed.
bgreen: Fast and shooting. Dodge that!
yellow: Move randomly around. Give good powerups when shot, money when crashed.
        Doesn't crash with enemies.
orange: Explode on crashing.
red: Are fast and evil and give money, when crashed into others.
???: Avoiding the player until shortly before and then try to strike.
boss1: Comes from behind, will follow and shoot the player and
        have to be crashed/shot by greens. # reds will not come, when a boss is there.
boss2: Flys besides the players and will try to ram them
-----
goals:
    survive onslaught
    get boss killed
    run away (reach upper bounds)
    get an amount of enemy type killed via crash and/or shot
-----
ammo is limited
bombs can have different effects (burst of normal, explosive shot,...)
-----
Upgrades:
    Every upgrade adds one bit.
    |||||
    Slots for equipment.
-----
multiple weapons with different ammo fired with different keys.
-----
the hud is in binary 'numbers'
    str(bin(<<value>>))[2:]

ammo: max(bin(31)) = 11111
bombs: max(bin(7)) = 111 # or max(bin(3)) = 11
lives: max(bin(7)) = 111

when ammo = 25:
ammo = str(bin(ammo)) # '0b11001'
ammo = ammo[2:] # '11001'
    # And now put the string into an Image:
surf = Image(ammo, {'1': 'red', '0': 'black'})
    # Then scale it, and we have a nice hud.

  lives                   score
