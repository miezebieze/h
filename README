OH HAI!
This is my first bigger project:

Featuring:
    * Graphics rendered from ascii for easy editing and to keep
      human unreadable stuff out of source.
    * Easily modifyable

Playing in Gnu/Linux and similar ones:
    cd game
    ./H.sh

Other OSs:
    # somehow get into ./game/
    # Do something like:
    $PATH_TO_PYTHON2/python H.py

Requirements:
    pygame
    python2
